# copy-file

## AIM:

To write a python program for copying the contents from one file to another file.

## EQUIPEMENT'S REQUIRED: 

PC
Anaconda - Python 3.7

## ALGORITHM: 

Step 1:
First we need to open the required file from which we need to copy the text.

Step 2:
Using keyword "with" to open the required file.

Step 3:
Again using the with keyword to open the empty file.

Step 4:
The empty file is open by using 'w' which is used to write only.

Step 5:
The for function is used to take each line from the main file.

Step 6:
write() is used to write the lines of main file to the empty file or to the directed file.

## PROGRAM:
